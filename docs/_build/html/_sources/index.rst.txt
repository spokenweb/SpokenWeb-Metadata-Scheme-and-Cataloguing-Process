1. Introduction
===============

Welcome to the SpokenWeb metadata cataloguing project!  Broadly speaking, a metadata scheme is a rationalized way of describing a collection with a set of rules according to which a controlled “language” operates. In this context, language means an artificial construct defined for the purposes of describing our collections in a systematic and consistent way. 

The following *SpokenWeb Metadata Scheme* consists of two documents: 1) **an Excel spreadsheet** is WHAT needs to be used to enter information about a collection, and 2) **the cataloguing rules (authority control and cataloguing procedures)** are documents designed to explain HOW to enter information in the Excel file.

1.1. How to Engage with a Collection
------------------------------------

Collections can differ from each other significantly.  Some have been born via analog media technologies (tape recorders, for example), some have been “born digital” (recorded as digital files directly onto flash or hard drives), and some may be a mixture of the two.  Some have been processed to some extent already using a different kind of cataloguing or metadata scheme, and others may never have been organized before. The nature and state of a collection, will have an impact on the way and ease with which you are able to catalogue the artifacts and objects in it. In most cases, in order to properly capture the information about the collection you will be describing with the SpokenWeb Metadata Scheme, you will engage in the following activities:

1. You will access and handle the collection and the artifacts through your local library or research center.  You will also require a computer while processing the collection so that you can input your metadata (data about the audio data) into our SpokenWeb Metadata Scheme form.  This form will be a Google Sheet during the testing phase of our processing located here (goo.gl/sn177V), and then we will develop an online system with fields that you will use to input your descriptive information.

2. Where possible, you will photograph the analogue assets (tapes, reels) and their containers. It will be important to identify and retain images about the collection as a secondary source of information, and these images may also be integrated into digital presentations of the collection down the road.  More information about how to do this appears below in the “Photographing Archival Assets” section.

3. You will engage in describing each artifact in the collection using the *fields* that comprise the SpokenWeb Metadata Scheme.  This will entail following a specific style of entering information into the relevant field categories, and may also entail seeking the information that you’ll need to fill in, either by examining the artifact, listening to the audible content of the sound recording, or by consulting external sources (i.e. doing research!).

4. A note on listening:  Given that some of the information that we will be including in our description will come from listening to the contents of the recordings themselves, a few initial points about how to listen, and what to listen for, are in order.  In listening to an archival recording for the purpose of cataloguing, the goal, in the first instance, is to capture a sense of the nature and overall contents of the recording in question.  If the digital file you are listening to was originally an analogue tape, for instance, that tape may have been used to capture a single event (say, a poetry reading that lasted an hour), or it may have been used to capture multiple events recorded at different times.  During the first listening, use a transcription software of your choice (we recommend Transcriva) and produce a time-stamped account of the contents of the audio artifact, noting with time stamps what we call discrete signature moments during the recorded audio event.  By signature moments we mean moments that signify important discrete sections in the audio.  For example, in a recording of a poetry reading event one may hear, first, a speaker deliver an introduction to the event, followed by the poet stepping up to the podium to read a series of poems from a book.  In this example, the introduction may provide you with information that will be useful to your description of the file.  The introducer may state his/her name, the date, the venue, the name of the invited poet who will soon read, and other points of information that may be required information for our metadata fields.  The introduction as a whole would comprise one discrete section of the audio that should be timestamped and named at the start as a signature moment with a timestamp and a tag that identifies the nature of the speech (i.e Introduction) and, if you have it, the name of the speaker.  When the poet begins to read you would then identify that beginning with a time stamp, identifying the name of the poet, and the nature of the next section of speech (i.e Introductory remarks).  When the poet begins to read you should then identify each poem read as a discrete section of the audio, thus describing the contents of the audio as it progresses with timestamps and poem titles.  If the recording consists of multiple events that took place at different times, these events would also be reflected in the timestamping description.  The result of this approach to listening will be the production of a “Table of Contents” (TOC) of sorts, for an audio recording.  Beyond the production of this audio TOC, you may also find important clues that will help you fill in your other metadata fields.  While such information often appears at the start of a recording (as I mentioned in my discussion of the Introduction), sometimes clues about who is speaking, where the event took place, etc., are found randomly throughout a recording.  Pay attention for such moments when names, dates, place names and poem and book titles are spoken as they can be useful to you as you work on describing the nature and contents of your audio object with as much accuracy as possible

2. Troubleshooting (what to do when you don’t know what to do
=============================================================

At times you may find that the information requested by this cataloguing process document is not available, or that the information you have does not easily fit into the scheme and rules of the SpokenWeb guidelines. Sometimes you will discover questions that the Guidelines document does not answer.  Therefore, you should document any questions, decisions or variables that are not addressed by the Guidelines, or that are contrary to them.  These documented questions and issues and other relevant points of information pertaining to the cataloguing process should be provided to your supervisor.   If your supervisor does not have the answer to your questions directly, s/he will then consult with the SpokenWeb Metadata Controller for advice on how to proceed.  Your documented questions and feedback will be integrated into our analysis of the process throughout the cataloguing activities so that we can continue to improve upon our scheme and clarify our description of the cataloguing process.

3. General Tips for Data Entry
==============================

We will add to this section of the Guidelines periodically, based on feedback and tips we receive from you, the cataloguers.

* Try not to leave fields blank if you are able to find and enter the information. 
* If the information you are required to enter is repetitive, copy-paste the information form earlier entries into new ones. 


4. How to Photograph Archival Assets
====================================

4.1. Technical Specifications (Equipment, Process)
--------------------------------------------------

If you are able to photograph the archival recordings, you should try to do so at the beginning of your cataloguing process.  Photograph each side of the artifact and its case, as well as any accompanying material containing textual information. Photographs should be in .jpeg or .png file format and have a minimum image width of 500 pixels.  [Add more details on lighting, framing, etc.]

4.2. How to name and format image files
---------------------------------------
In taking photos of the archival audio artifacts, you will be generating new data (digital image files) and those files will also need to be named properly for easy use.  Each filename of an image should have the following syntax:

Enter in Asset Image File Name Field on the excel document. 

  [Collection name]_[Fonds number]_[Box number]_ID_Side number.jpeg [*]_


NOTE: Not all collections will be coming from archives, so this syntax won't apply to all. The proper way to name files for digital photos in this case is underdevelopment. 

* Kiyooka_Msc321_Box8_128_Side1.jpeg
* Kiyooka_Msc321_Box10_insert.jpeg
* Gilbert_21_Side2.png
* Ultimatum_5-3_Side1.png

.. [*] *Collection name* may be derived from the name of the fonds. If the fonds is author fonds, then use the author’s last name (i.e. “Kiyooka”, “Gilbert”, etc.). If the fonds is an event series, use the name of the series (i.e. “Ultimatum”, “Véhicule”, etc.). Supply fonds and box number when available, and use any extant ID numbers if the collection has already been catalogued. The object is always the primary source of information for determining a unique ID number. 


5. Metadata Fields 
==================

Each metadata field will help us to describe the object, as well as the process by which it has been made, remediated and catalogued.  It will also be important for discovery when we are able to put the recordings online.  There are overarching Fields of the scheme, and some of these overarching Fields will have numerous sub-elements that you’ll fill in separately. 

| **Legend**
| M = mandatory (colour-coded as green)
| C = conditional (mandatory if present), (colour-coded as yellow in the excel document)
| Re = recommended: to be defined 
| R = repeatable: to be defined 
| NR = non-repeatable: to be defined 

5.1. Cataloguer
---------------

That’s you.  The cataloguer refers to the individual who is cataloguing a particular artifact.  Having your name associated with the entry will help us find you if we have any questions about how you’ve filled in a field, and also will identify your contributions to this project over time.  Select your name from the drop-down menu. Let your supervisor know if your name does not appear in the drop-down menu and we can add it. 

**Cataloguer Last Name, First Name:** Select your name from the drop-down menu 

5.2. Partner Institution Fields
-------------------------------

**Partner Institution:** Select the name of the institution that the collection is affiliated with from the drop-down menu. For collections that are not affiliated with any institutions, enter “Community Collection”.  

**Contributing Unit:** Select from the drop-down menu, Contributing Unit Special, for example Collections and Rare Books (if available)

**Source Collection:** Enter title proper for a fonds or collection to provide sufficient information to identify and find the original resource, for example: Daphne Marlatt fonds.

**Source Collection Description:** Copy/paste source collection description from online library catalogue into the corresponding field or develop one with your supervisor (it should include some interesting things about a collection, such as names of poets featured on artifacts, year of broadcast, etc.)

**Source Collection ID Number:** A reference code or id number of the related resource from which the described resource is derived, for example: MsC 142.

**Item ID Number/Identifier:**  This is an unambiguous reference to the resource within a given context:: 123 (if available).

**Persistent URL:** Provide a link to the Item that you are describing, if available.

5.3. Material Description (for Physical & Digital Items Fields)
---------------------------------------------------------------

**Definition:**  The Material Description for Physical and Digital Items provides information about the material specifications of the artifact or object being described.  Some of the questions this field will answer include: What is it made of?  What are the technical specifications according to which it functions?  What are its affordances or capacities?  What’s its condition? Etc.  The term Item refers to the original source item of the digital audio signal, or the original digital audio file (if born digital).  Related items (such as migration copies) may be accounted for in the Notes field.

**General Guidelines:**

  * Provide information about any important physical or material characteristics, or technical requirements that affect use of the item of description or understanding of the item.
  * Pick only one Item to be described. It can be made up of multiple parts and formats. Include in the Notes any information about related items, such as additional copies, versions or available formats of the Item. 
  * As noted by most schemes consulted, “technology for digital audio files and mass storage systems is [and was] still evolving” (IASA). Therefore, include “at least a minimum of information and description of the physical characteristics for Local Access Files (as defined by IASA)” that will allow the configuration of equipment to play back the files correctly (IASA). System requirements and modes of access should be described in the Note field.

**Chief Source(s) of Information: **

  * Most of the information you will seek can be found on the physical units of description (the material things you’re describing), including the container, labels and other materials that might accompany the Item.  For example, a reel to reel tape (physical unit of description) may come in a tape box (container) and have a card inside the box (other material) with additional technical info about the recording typed on it.
  * If information is taken from sources other than the Chief Source of Information (the Item and its container/components), please identify the sources of this externally-found information in the Notes.

5.4. Preliminary Material Description Fields
--------------------------------------------

**Recording Type:** Determine if the original unit of description is analogue or digital.   (This will probably be self-evident.  Basically determine if it’s a thing or a digital file). Select Analogue or Digital from the drop-down menu. If it is Analogue, select the appropriate **AV Type** and then go to the **Physical Items Fields** to continue entering the data.  If it is digital, select the appropriate **AV Type** and then go to the **Digital Items Fields** to continue entering the data.

**AV Type:** Determine and indicate if the item contains audio or video (with audio).  Again, this will likely be self-evident, but should be indicated in the AV TYPE field.

Identify the AV Type with either Audio or Video.

5.5. Physical Items Fields
--------------------------

**Material Designation:** Assign a Specific Material Designation to the Item.  The specific material designation identifies the particular class of material to which the item belongs.  For our scheme, we have identified a set number of material designations that we believe will be the most common within our collections.  For material designations not found on our list, please consult with the Metadata Task Force (or propose a suggestion from the IASA Glossary).  

  * Reel to Reel
  * 8-Track Cartridge
  * Cassette
  * Microcassette
  * Wire
  * DAT 
  * Disc
  * CD
  * Minidisc
  * Cylinder
  * U-Matic
  * Betamax
  * VHS
  * Hi8
  * MiniDV

**Physical Composition:**  This refers to the material medium used to capture the audio.  For example, reel to reel will usually refer to magnetic tape, but may also refer to a medium of magnetic wire.  A flat disc record may be made of vinyl, but it may also be made of shellac or aluminum.  The most common materials for this category are as follows:

  * Magnetic Tape (usually Reel to Reel, 8-Track Cartridge or Cassette)
  * Vinyl (usually discs)
  * Lacquer (usually discs)
  * Shellac (usually discs)
  * Wax (usually cylinders)
  * Laser (this includes CDs and videodiscs)
  * Magneto-Optical (this includes minidiscs)

**Storage Capacity of Artifact:**  In the case of some media formats, like audio cassette tapes, there will sometimes be a playing time duration indicated on the artifact itself.  This refers to the total time storage capacity of the artifact when the media format is played at the standard speed associated with the medium.   For example, was the recording made on a 60 minute tape or a 90 minute tape?  The time storage capacity should be written in the following manner:

  :T:
    indicates that a time value follows. (Any value with a time must begin with T).
  :hh:
    specifies a two-digit hour
  :mm:
    as part of time, specifies a two-digit minute
  :ss:
    specifies a two-digit second
    
  Use this format:
    Thh:mm:ss

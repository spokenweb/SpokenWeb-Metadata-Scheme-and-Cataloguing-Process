<p>Each metadata field will help us to describe the object, as well as the process by which it has been made, remediated and catalogued.  It will also be important for discovery when we are able to put the recordings online.  There are overarching Fields of the scheme, and some of these overarching Fields will have numerous sub-elements that you’ll fill in separately.</p>

<h2>5.3. Material Description (for Physical &amp; Digital Items Fields)<a class="headerlink" href="#material-description-for-physical-digital-items-fields" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  The Material Description for Physical and Digital Items provides information about the material specifications of the artifact or object being described.  Some of the questions this field will answer include: What is it made of?  What are the technical specifications according to which it functions?  What are its affordances or capacities?  What’s its condition? Etc.  The term Item refers to the original source item of the digital audio signal, or the original digital audio file (if born digital).  Related items (such as migration copies) may be accounted for in the Notes field.</p>
<p><strong>General Guidelines:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Provide information about any important physical or material characteristics, or technical requirements that affect use of the item of description or understanding of the item.</li>
<li>Pick only one Item to be described. It can be made up of multiple parts and formats. Include in the Notes any information about related items, such as additional copies, versions or available formats of the Item.</li>
<li>As noted by most schemes consulted, “technology for digital audio files and mass storage systems is [and was] still evolving” (IASA). Therefore, include “at least a minimum of information and description of the physical characteristics for Local Access Files (as defined by IASA)” that will allow the configuration of equipment to play back the files correctly (IASA). System requirements and modes of access should be described in the Note field.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Chief Source(s) of Information:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Most of the information you will seek can be found on the physical units of description (the material things you’re describing), including the container, labels and other materials that might accompany the Item.  For example, a reel to reel tape (physical unit of description) may come in a tape box (container) and have a card inside the box (other material) with additional technical info about the recording typed on it.</li>
<li>If information is taken from sources other than the Chief Source of Information (the Item and its container/components), please identify the sources of this externally-found information in the Notes.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="preliminary-material-description-fields">
<h2>5.4. Preliminary Material Description Fields<a class="headerlink" href="#preliminary-material-description-fields" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Recording Type:</strong> Determine if the original unit of description is analogue or digital. (This will probably be self-evident.  Basically determine if it’s a thing or a digital file). Select Analogue or Digital from the drop-down menu. If it is Analogue, select the appropriate <strong>AV Type</strong> and then go to the <strong>Physical Items Fields</strong> to continue entering the data.  If it is digital, select the appropriate <strong>AV Type</strong> and then go to the <strong>Digital Items Fields</strong> to continue entering the data.</p>
<p><strong>AV Type:</strong> Determine and indicate if the item contains audio or video (with audio).  Again, this will likely be self-evident, but should be indicated in the AV TYPE field.</p>
<p>Identify the AV Type with either Audio or Video.</p>

<div class="section" id="physical-items-fields">
<h2>5.5. Physical Items Fields<a class="headerlink" href="#physical-items-fields" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Material Designation:</strong> Assign a Specific Material Designation to the Item.  The specific material designation identifies the particular class of material to which the item belongs.  For our scheme, we have identified a set number of material designations that we believe will be the most common within our collections.  For material designations not found on our list, please consult with the Metadata Task Force (or propose a suggestion from the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.iasa-web.org/cataloguing-rules/appendix-d-glossary">IASA Glossary</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Reel to Reel</li>
<li>8-Track Cartridge</li>
<li>Cassette</li>
<li>Microcassette</li>
<li>Wire</li>

<li>Betamax</li>
<li>VHS</li>
<li>Hi8</li>
<li>MiniDV</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Physical Composition:</strong>  This refers to the material medium used to capture the audio.  For example, reel to reel will usually refer to magnetic tape, but may also refer to a medium of magnetic wire.  A flat disc record may be made of vinyl, but it may also be made of shellac or aluminum.  The most common materials for this category are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Magnetic Tape (usually Reel to Reel, 8-Track Cartridge or Cassette)</li>
<li>Vinyl (usually discs)</li>
<li>Lacquer (usually discs)</li>
<li>Shellac (usually discs)</li>
<li>Wax (usually cylinders)</li>
<li>Laser (this includes CDs and videodiscs)</li>
<li>Magneto-Optical (this includes minidiscs)</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Storage Capacity of Artifact:</strong> In the case of some media formats, like audio cassette tapes, there will sometimes be a playing time duration indicated on the artifact itself.  This refers to the total time storage capacity of the artifact when the media format is played at the standard speed associated with the medium.   For example, was the recording made on a 60 minute tape or a 90 minute tape?  The time storage capacity should be written in the following manner:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><table class="docutils field-list" frame="void" rules="none">
<col class="field-name" />
<col class="field-body" />
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="field-odd field"><th class="field-name">T:</th><td class="field-body">indicates that a time value follows. (Any value with a time must begin with T).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="field-even field"><th class="field-name">hh:</th><td class="field-body">specifies a two-digit hour</td>
</tr>
<tr class="field-odd field"><th class="field-name">mm:</th><td class="field-body">as part of time, specifies a two-digit minute</td>
</tr>
<tr class="field-even field"><th class="field-name">ss:</th><td class="field-body">specifies a two-digit second</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Use this format:</dt>
<dd>Thh:mm:ss</dd>
</dl>
<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>90 minutes = T01:30:00
45 minutes = T00:45:00
3 minutes and 21 seconds = T00 :03 :21</div></blockquote>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Extent:</strong>  Extent refers to the size of the media storage material. For tapes this refers to the width of the tape.  For discs, the size of the record’s diameter dimension.  For example, common sizes are:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Tape:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>1/8 inch (audio cassette tapes)</li>
<li>1/4 inch (most portable reel to reel tapes)</li>
<li>1/2 inch</li>
<li>3/4 inch</li>
<li>1 inch</li>
<li>2 inch</li>
</ul>
<p>Discs:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>12 inch (the diameter of traditional “LPs”)</li>
<li>10 inch (often 78s were in this diameter,</li>
<li>7 inch (the diameter of traditional “45s”</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p><em>Side:</em>  For certain media such as audio cassette tapes that divide the length of the magnetic tape into half-tracks, and for two sided discs (vinyl, etc.) You should indicate the Side (A or B) that the content of the digital file refers to.  So if a digital file has captured audio from Side A of an audio cassette tape, you should mark A in the Side field.  If a digital file combines audio from both sides of an audiocassette or record, then you can mark A and B in this field.</p>
<p><em>Playing Speed:</em>  Give the playback or playing speed of the physical unit as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>For analogue discs: give the playback speed in revolutions per minute (rpm). Examples of common playback speeds for analogue discs follow:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>16 2/3 rpm</li>
<li>33 1/3 rpm</li>
<li>45 rpm</li>
<li>78 rpm</li>
</ul>
<p>For sound tape reels: give the playback speed in inches per second (ips). Round the playback speed to the nearest full figure, if appropriate.  The most common speeds are as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>3 3/4  ips</li>
<li>7 1/2 ips</li>
<li>15 ips</li>
<li>30 ips</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="notes-for-physical-items">
<h3>5.5.1. Notes for Physical Items<a class="headerlink" href="#notes-for-physical-items" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Where possible, include the following additional information in the Notes field:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Track Configuration:</strong>  For audio tapes, if possible, give the number of tracks, unless the number of tracks is standard for the unit being described. If necessary, give the track configuration. For example:  Half-track. 2 track. 4 track,  24&nbsp;track</p>
<p><strong>Playback Mode:</strong>  Give the playback mode [or number of sound channels] if the information is readily available, using one or more of the following terms as appropriate. Some types of playback mode follow:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Mono (1 channel)</li>
<li>Stereo  (2 channels, or “hi-fi”)</li>
<li>binaural stereo (also known as dummyhead)</li>
<li>quadrophonic  (4 channels)</li>
<li>surround sound</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Equalization:</strong> [to be developed]</p>
<p><strong>Tape Brand:</strong> Where indicated on the artifact, or reliably on the container, record the tape brand and the specific type number, for example, Ampex 456 or Scotch 250. This makes all the difference in being able to track degradation issues (sticky shed syndrome) from the item metadata. Knowing if it’s Scotch 200, or Scotch 250, or Scotch 300 is relevant for the preservation purposes.  When the info is available, it’s usually written clearly on the box. Older tapes will often have named lines of tape, sometimes on a shiny sticker or something that might say, for example, “Radio Mastering Extraordinaire”. This can be helpful to know, and would be great to record, if it’s readily available. If it’s not obvious, then write down “Unknown acetate”.</p>
<p><strong>Accompanying Material:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Issued with illustrated sleeve and liner notes</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Other physical description:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Examples:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Impressed on rectangular surface 20 x 20 cm Reproduced from inner to outer grooves</li>
<li>Recorded with clip-on microphone</li>
<li>Recorded on 1 side of 1 audio disc</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Generations:</strong> Distinguish between different generations of material.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Copy from an original loaned by UTARMS</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Sound Quality:</strong> Based on broad categories of clarity and audibility, grade the audio quality of the recording as either Excellent, Good, or Poor.</p>
<p><strong>Physical condition:</strong> Make notes on the physical condition of the unit being described if that condition affects use or understanding of the unit.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Indicate any important physical conditions, such as preservation requirements, that affect the use of the unit of description (ISAD G 3.4.4) or understanding of it.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Sticky shed syndrome</li>
<li>Fungus growth impairs playback</li>
<li>Rejected cuts scratched through by operator</li>
<li>Several tracks scratched through by operator</li>
<li>Recorded with a constant audible hum</li>
<li>Speed varies due to weak batteries at time of original recording</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>

<div class="section" id="title">
<h2>5.7. Title<a class="headerlink" href="#title" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A word or phrase, usually appearing on an artifact (either <strong>digital file</strong> or <strong>analogue artifact</strong> or <strong>container</strong>), naming the item or the work (often as a group of individual works or recorded sounds) contained in it.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
<p>The Title field has two objectives: 1) to identify the artifact and 2) to describe it. The primarily role for the Title is to identify the artifact. If the information on the artifact is useful for this purpose, it should be used as a Title. If the information on the artifact does not allow to identify the item (for example, if all of the artifacts in the collection have the same information written on them), then a descriptive Title should be generated to identify each artifact in a collection. If sufficiently descriptive, format it like this: [Name of Speaker] at [Venue] and [Year].</p>
<p>Capitalize the first letter of the first word and of the first letter of proper nouns and additional words according to the appropriate usage in the language in which the material is catalogued. Put square brackets around the descriptive title.</p>
<p>Example: [Phyllis Webb at Sir George Williams University, 1966]</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>If [Name of Speaker], [Venue], or [Year] are missing then only include information that is available.</p>
<p>Use the Title Source field to cite the sources of information.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The following is the order of preference for the source of title information:</p>
<blockquote>

<h2>5.12. Genre<a class="headerlink" href="#genre" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In our usage, genre is distinguished from recording type or kind, which we refer to and define in terms of the production context.  The recording type refers to the production scenario of the recording, whereas genre refers to the audiotextual forms audible (discernible) within the recording.  In this way, we are establishing a metadata field that is descriptive of content, from a generic perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Genre is a term or terms that designate a category characterizing a particular style, form, or content, such as artistic, musical, literary composition, etc.  In the generic terms we have chosen it is assumed that the genre refers to an audible source produced through speech or by other means. You will need to listen to the recording to determine genre.</p>
<p>NOTE: A single recording can contain multiple genres. If the audiotext you are listening to consists of more than one genre, list them separated by comma.  However, in listing the genres of a recording, you should concentrate on the most <em>prominent</em> or <em>dominant</em> generic features and content of the audiotext.  For example, if an hour long recording of a poetry reading has a moment or two of conversation about the microphone at the start of the recording, the genre for this recording should be poetry, and not poetry, conversation.  You will have to use your judgment in determining the audiotextual genres most appropriate for your each recording you listen to.  We have provided a series of terms that will assist you in this work.</p>
<p>Genre should be chosen from the following controlled vocabulary of terms. Note that more than one genre might be applicable to a single artifact, and multiple terms are allowed. Again: how do you make a decision on when to assign a specific genre?  It has to be among the most salient audible features of an artifact.</p>
<p>Here is the list of terms you must draw from:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Conversations</li>
<li>Interviews</li>
<li>Letters</li>
<li>Oral histories</li>
<li>Oral storytelling</li>
<li>Performances<ul>

<li>Readings<ul>
<li>Drama</li>
<li>Fiction</li>
<li>Poetry</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Definitions of genre terms</strong></p>
<p><strong>Conversations:</strong> The informal exchange of ideas and information between two or more people by spoken words.</p>
<p><strong>Interviews:</strong> Recordings of formal meetings at which information is obtained (as by a reporter, radio commentator, or researcher) from a person.</p>
<p><strong>Letters:</strong> Recordings of written text or extemporaneous speech directed or sent to a person or group of people.</p>
<p><strong>Oral histories:</strong> Recorded accounts of historical information about individuals, families, important events, or everyday life, derived through planned interviews.</p>
<p><strong>Oral storytelling:</strong> Oral narrative stories delivered by one or more speaker(s) that may draw on or adapt traditional folk story forms. Storytelling differs from oral histories in that the content is generally told to an audience or community with the purpose of engaging and/or entertaining and/or sharing a lesson or knowledge with them in the delivery of a narrative.  Further, they are not the result of an interviewer-interviewee dynamic, but are delivered by a storyteller who is self-consciously inhabiting that role on his or her own.</p>
<p><strong>Performances:</strong> Recordings of creative works designed specifically for oral performance.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Improvised speech:</strong> Recordings of extemporaneous speech produced in the context of a performance.</p>
<p><strong>Sound Poetry:</strong> Poetry meant to be performed that emphasizes sounds instead of the semantic meaning of the words themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Spoken word poetry:</strong> Poetry that is meant to be performed and that is heavily stressed, metrically regular, and characterized by improvisation, free association, and word play.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Readings:</strong> Recordings of the recitation of a literary work.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Drama:</strong> a composition in verse or prose intended to portray life or character or to tell a story usually involving conflicts and emotions through action and dialogue and typically designed for theatrical performance.</p>
<p><strong>Fiction:</strong> Readings of literature in the form of prose, especially short stories and novels, that describes imaginary events and people.</p>
<p><strong>Poetry:</strong> Readings of literature in the form of verse or other literary forms identified with this genre of literature.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Sounds:</strong> Non-speech sounds.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Ambient sounds:</strong> Recordings of sounds of the surrounding environment external to an audio system that are often recorded separately and mixed into other recordings to enhance live effect.</p>
<p><strong>Music:</strong> Sonic works produced with musical instruments and/or the human voice that order tones or sounds in succession, in combination, and in temporal relationships.</p>
<p><strong>Soundscapes:</strong>  Compositions that consist of natural or synthetic sounds from specific locations that are sometimes manipulated electronically.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Speeches:</strong> A formal address or discourse delivered to an audience.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Commemorative works:</strong> Speeches (as in toasts, roasts, eulogies, and encomiums) that act as a memorial or mark of an event or a person.</p>
<p><strong>Panels:</strong> Recordings that feature discussions of topics by panels of speakers or experts.</p>
<p><strong>Question-and-answer periods:</strong> Recordings that feature speakers or experts responding to questions posed by a live or remote audience.</p>
<p><strong>Talks:</strong> Recordings that feature talks or lectures by individual speakers or experts.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Text-sound compositions:</strong> Musical compositions consisting primarily of electronically and/or computer-altered or computer synthesized spoken words.</p>

<h2>5.13. Statement of Responsibility<a class="headerlink" href="#statement-of-responsibility" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Statements of responsibility describe the persons or corporate bodies responsible for the intellectual or artistic content of a work. This definition should be interpreted as broadly as possible to include any and all entities that contributed to the creation, performance or realization of a work. This is similar to the concept of “authorship” but is intentionally much broader.</p>
<p>Categories include:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Creators of the intellectual or artistic content of the work</li>
<li>Performers of whose participation is confined to performance, execution, or interpretation</li>
<li>Performers, narrators, and/or presenters</li>
<li>Persons who have contributed to the artistic and/or technical production of a resource</li>
<li>Persons, families, or corporate bodies responsible for the production, publication, distribution, or manufacture of a resource</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Special attention should be paid to include the different kinds of contribution relevant to audiotextual works:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Recordists</li>
<li>Series organizers</li>
<li>Collectors</li>
<li>Archivists</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Responsibility can be extended to include not just voices/speakers on a given recording, but other creators/contributors not present. For example, a performance of a poem by another author would constitute a kind of responsibility.</p>

<div class="section" id="date">
<h2>5.14. Date<a class="headerlink" href="#date" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We want our items to have dates associated with them so that we can understand their significance within historical timelines, both in relation to other literary or historical events, and in relation to each other.  Determining a date may seem simple, but that is not always the case.</p>
<p><strong>Finding the Information:</strong>  First, think about where your information is coming from.  Chief Source(s) of Information is the source from which the Date is taken or determined.  In the case of our project, the chief source of information is, ideally, the sound recording being described, or the unit of description. This includes the object itself as well as any labels, notes or accompanying material. The Chief Sources of Information are one or more of the following resources.</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>the item itself, including any labels, etc., that are permanently affixed to the item or a container that is an integral part of the item</li>
<li>the container itself (e.g., a box)</li>
<li>accompanying material (e.g., technical recording slips)</li>
</ol>
<p>If the information is taken from a source other than one of these sources, this <em>must</em> be stated in the <strong>Date Notes</strong> field.  No square brackets should be used in the Date field to indicate a supplied date. Both the source and an explanation of the supplied information must therefore be provided in the Notes.  Even if one or more of the Chief Sources of Information are used, it is still recommended that the source be provided in the Notes field.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Perform the following steps as closely as possible in order to catalogue the item:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Decide and select from the dropdown menu which one of the following two Date Types best describes the work:</li>

<p>Where was a recording made?  Answering this question may provide us with interesting information about where literary events and activities occurred across the country.  We will be using a few methods of capturing location information, and will be entering this data according to a set syntax.  The three primary fields related to location are the <strong>Address</strong> (which refers to the official street address of a location), the <strong>Venue</strong> (that is, the name of the venue where something was recorded), and then, as a recommended field, the <strong>Latitude</strong> and <strong>Longitude</strong> of the location as well as a <strong>URI</strong> for that location.

<h2>5.18. Contents<a class="headerlink" href="#contents" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The contents field will be developed through a process that involves listening, timestamping important moments in the recording, and, at times, research in order to determine correct names and titles relevant to the recording.  This combination of timestamped titles and names will function as the equivalent of a table of contents for a sound recording and may eventually be used to facilitate the online navigation of a recording.</p>
<p>The basic procedure for generating a timestamped contents list entails using a transcription software that allows you to control the listening speed of a recording, enter notes through an automated timestamping mechanism provided by the software, and then export that information so that it can be pasted into the content notes field.  If you are using a Mac computer, Transcriva is a good software to use for this purpose, although there are many other transcription software programs that will do the trick.  You may also wish to use a system that has a foot control to pause as you’re typing.</p>
<p>As you are producing your timestamped contents description of the recording you should timestamp and thus signal the start and end of each event of discrete significance.  For our purposes this will usually mean changes in speaker and discrete literary works read.  For example, If you are listening to a reading that has someone introducing the reader, you would first timestamp the beginning of the introduction and title this with the term Introduction and then the name of the Introducer.  For example, Warren Tallman introduces Robert Creely. Then, when the reader steps up to the microphone you would indicate that with a new timestamp followed by the name of the reader.  If the reader is introducing a poem, you would follow his/her name by Introduces and then the title of the poem, for example, Dorothy Livesay introduces Outrider.  Then when the reading of that actual poem begins you would timestamp that moment with the name of the reader and the title of the poem, so, Dorothy Livesay reads Outrider</p>
<p>A proper timestamping tool is in development; however, if you choose to do timestamping manually, format the timestamps following XML as below.  For a simple series of timestamps:</p>
<div class="highlight-xml notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">&lt;item</span> <span class="na">label=</span><span class="s">&quot;Imaginary Recording&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>

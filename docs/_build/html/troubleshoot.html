<p>At times you may find that the information requested by this cataloguing process document is not available, or that the information you have does not easily fit into the scheme and rules of the SpokenWeb guidelines. Sometimes you will discover questions that the Guidelines document does not answer.  Therefore, you should document any questions, decisions or variables that are not addressed by the Guidelines, or that are contrary to them.  These documented questions and issues and other relevant points of information pertaining to the cataloguing process should be provided to your supervisor.   If your supervisor does not have the answer to your questions directly, s/he will then consult with the SpokenWeb Metadata Controller for advice on how to proceed.  Your documented questions and feedback will be integrated into our analysis of the process throughout the cataloguing activities so that we can continue to improve upon our scheme and clarify our description of the cataloguing process.</p>

<h1>3. General Tips for Data Entry<a class="headerlink" href="#general-tips-for-data-entry" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>We will add to this section of the Guidelines periodically, based on feedback and tips we receive from you, the cataloguers.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Try not to leave fields blank if you are able to find and enter the information.</li>
<li>If the information you are required to enter is repetitive, copy-paste the information form earlier entries into new ones.</li>

<div class="section" id="technical-specifications-equipment-process">
<h2>4.1. Technical Specifications (Equipment, Process)<a class="headerlink" href="#technical-specifications-equipment-process" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you are able to photograph the archival recordings, you should try to do so at the beginning of your cataloguing process.  Photograph each side of the artifact and its case, as well as any accompanying material containing textual information. Photographs should be in .jpeg or .png file format and have a minimum image width of 500 pixels.  [Add more details on lighting, framing, etc.]</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-to-name-and-format-image-files">
<h2>4.2. How to name and format image files<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-name-and-format-image-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In taking photos of the archival audio artifacts, you will be generating new data (digital image files) and those files will also need to be named properly for easy use.  Each filename of an image should have the following syntax:</p>
<p>Enter in Asset Image File Name Field on the excel document.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>[Collection name]_[Fonds number]_[Box number]_ID_Side number.jpeg <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[*]</a></div></blockquote>
<p>NOTE: Not all collections will be coming from archives, so this syntax won’t apply to all. The proper way to name files for digital photos in this case is underdevelopment.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Kiyooka_Msc321_Box8_128_Side1.jpeg</li>
<li>Kiyooka_Msc321_Box10_insert.jpeg</li>
<li>Gilbert_21_Side2.png</li>
<li>Ultimatum_5-3_Side1.png</li>
</ul>

<colgroup><col class="label" /><col /></colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td class="label"><a class="fn-backref" href="#id1">[*]</a></td><td><p class="first">Collection name may be derived from the name of the fonds. If the fonds is author fonds, then use the author’s last name (i.e. “Kiyooka”, “Gilbert”, etc.). If the fonds is an event series, use the name of the series (i.e. “Ultimatum”, “Véhicule”, etc.). Supply fonds and box number when available, and use any extant ID numbers if the collection has already been catalogued. The object is always the primary source of information for determining a unique ID number.</p>
<p class="last">Note that there should be no spaces in the filename and that only the first letter of each term is capitalized. List all file names using a comma.</p>

<h2>5.3. Material Description (for Physical &amp; Digital Items Fields)<a class="headerlink" href="#material-description-for-physical-digital-items-fields" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong>  The Material Description for Physical and Digital Items provides information about the material specifications of the artifact or object being described.  Some of the questions this field will answer include: What is it made of?  What are the technical specifications according to which it functions?  What are its affordances or capacities?  What’s its condition? Etc.  The term Item refers to the original source item of the digital audio signal, or the original digital audio file (if born digital).  Related items (such as migration copies) may be accounted for in the Notes field.</p>
<p><strong>General Guidelines:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Provide information about any important physical or material characteristics, or technical requirements that affect use of the item of description or understanding of the item.</li>
<li>Pick only one Item to be described. It can be made up of multiple parts and formats. Include in the Notes any information about related items, such as additional copies, versions or available formats of the Item.</li>
<li>As noted by most schemes consulted, “technology for digital audio files and mass storage systems is [and was] still evolving” (IASA). Therefore, include “at least a minimum of information and description of the physical characteristics for Local Access Files (as defined by IASA)” that will allow the configuration of equipment to play back the files correctly (IASA). System requirements and modes of access should be described in the Note field.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p><a href="#id3"><span class="problematic" id="id4">**</span></a>Chief Source(s) of Information: **</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Most of the information you will seek can be found on the physical units of description (the material things you’re describing), including the container, labels and other materials that might accompany the Item.  For example, a reel to reel tape (physical unit of description) may come in a tape box (container) and have a card inside the box (other material) with additional technical info about the recording typed on it.</li>
<li>If information is taken from sources other than the Chief Source of Information (the Item and its container/components), please identify the sources of this externally-found information in the Notes.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="preliminary-material-description-fields">
<h2>5.4. Preliminary Material Description Fields<a class="headerlink" href="#preliminary-material-description-fields" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Recording Type:</strong> Determine if the original unit of description is analogue or digital. (This will probably be self-evident.  Basically determine if it’s a thing or a digital file). Select Analogue or Digital from the drop-down menu. If it is Analogue, select the appropriate <strong>AV Type</strong> and then go to the <strong>Physical Items Fields</strong> to continue entering the data.  If it is digital, select the appropriate <strong>AV Type</strong> and then go to the <strong>Digital Items Fields</strong> to continue entering the data.</p>
<p><strong>AV Type:</strong> Determine and indicate if the item contains audio or video (with audio).  Again, this will likely be self-evident, but should be indicated in the AV TYPE field.</p>
<p>Identify the AV Type with either Audio or Video.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="physical-items-fields">
<h2>5.5. Physical Items Fields<a class="headerlink" href="#physical-items-fields" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Material Designation:</strong> Assign a Specific Material Designation to the Item.  The specific material designation identifies the particular class of material to which the item belongs.  For our scheme, we have identified a set number of material designations that we believe will be the most common within our collections.  For material designations not found on our list, please consult with the Metadata Task Force (or propose a suggestion from the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.iasa-web.org/cataloguing-rules/appendix-d-glossary">IASA Glossary</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Reel to Reel</li>
<li>8-Track Cartridge</li>
<li>Cassette</li>
<li>Microcassette</li>
<li>Wire</li>
<li>DAT</li>
<li>Disc</li>

<li>Cylinder</li>
<li>U-Matic</li>
<li>Betamax</li>
<li>VHS</li>
<li>Hi8</li>
<li>MiniDV</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Physical Composition:</strong>  This refers to the material medium used to capture the audio.  For example, reel to reel will usually refer to magnetic tape, but may also refer to a medium of magnetic wire.  A flat disc record may be made of vinyl, but it may also be made of shellac or aluminum.  The most common materials for this category are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Magnetic Tape (usually Reel to Reel, 8-Track Cartridge or Cassette)</li>
<li>Vinyl (usually discs)</li>
<li>Lacquer (usually discs)</li>
<li>Shellac (usually discs)</li>
<li>Wax (usually cylinders)</li>
<li>Laser (this includes CDs and videodiscs)</li>
<li>Magneto-Optical (this includes minidiscs)</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Storage Capacity of Artifact:</strong> In the case of some media formats, like audio cassette tapes, there will sometimes be a playing time duration indicated on the artifact itself.  This refers to the total time storage capacity of the artifact when the media format is played at the standard speed associated with the medium.   For example, was the recording made on a 60 minute tape or a 90 minute tape?  The time storage capacity should be written in the following manner:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><table class="docutils field-list" frame="void" rules="none">
<col class="field-name" />
<col class="field-body" />
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="field-odd field"><th class="field-name">T:</th><td class="field-body">indicates that a time value follows. (Any value with a time must begin with T).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="field-even field"><th class="field-name">hh:</th><td class="field-body">specifies a two-digit hour</td>
</tr>
<tr class="field-odd field"><th class="field-name">mm:</th><td class="field-body">as part of time, specifies a two-digit minute</td>
</tr>
<tr class="field-even field"><th class="field-name">ss:</th><td class="field-body">specifies a two-digit second</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Use this format:</dt>
<dd>Thh:mm:ss</dd>
</dl>
<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>90 minutes = T01:30:00
45 minutes = T00:45:00
3 minutes and 21 seconds = T00 :03 :21</div></blockquote>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Extent:</strong>  Extent refers to the size of the media storage material. For tapes this refers to the width of the tape.  For discs, the size of the record’s diameter dimension.  For example, common sizes are:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Tape:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>1/8 inch (audio cassette tapes)</li>
<li>1/4 inch (most portable reel to reel tapes)</li>
<li>1/2 inch</li>
<li>3/4 inch</li>
<li>1 inch</li>
<li>2 inch</li>
</ul>
<p>Discs:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>12 inch (the diameter of traditional “LPs”)</li>
<li>10 inch (often 78s were in this diameter,</li>
<li>7 inch (the diameter of traditional “45s”</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p><em>Side:</em>  For certain media such as audio cassette tapes that divide the length of the magnetic tape into half-tracks, and for two sided discs (vinyl, etc.) You should indicate the Side (A or B) that the content of the digital file refers to.  So if a digital file has captured audio from Side A of an audio cassette tape, you should mark A in the Side field.  If a digital file combines audio from both sides of an audiocassette or record, then you can mark A and B in this field.</p>
<p><em>Playing Speed:</em>  Give the playback or playing speed of the physical unit as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>For analogue discs: give the playback speed in revolutions per minute (rpm). Examples of common playback speeds for analogue discs follow:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>16 2/3 rpm</li>
<li>33 1/3 rpm</li>
<li>45 rpm</li>
<li>78 rpm</li>
</ul>
<p>For sound tape reels: give the playback speed in inches per second (ips). Round the playback speed to the nearest full figure, if appropriate.  The most common speeds are as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>3 3/4  ips</li>
<li>7 1/2 ips</li>
<li>15 ips</li>
<li>30 ips</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<div class="section" id="notes-for-physical-items">
<h3>5.5.1. Notes for Physical Items<a class="headerlink" href="#notes-for-physical-items" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Where possible, include the following additional information in the Notes field:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Track Configuration:</strong>  For audio tapes, if possible, give the number of tracks, unless the number of tracks is standard for the unit being described. If necessary, give the track configuration. For example:  Half-track. 2 track. 4 track,  24&nbsp;track</p>
<p><strong>Playback Mode:</strong>  Give the playback mode [or number of sound channels] if the information is readily available, using one or more of the following terms as appropriate. Some types of playback mode follow:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Mono (1 channel)</li>
<li>Stereo  (2 channels, or “hi-fi”)</li>
<li>binaural stereo (also known as dummyhead)</li>
<li>quadrophonic  (4 channels)</li>
<li>surround sound</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Equalization:</strong> [to be developed]</p>
<p><strong>Tape Brand:</strong> Where indicated on the artifact, or reliably on the container, record the tape brand and the specific type number, for example, Ampex 456 or Scotch 250. This makes all the difference in being able to track degradation issues (sticky shed syndrome) from the item metadata. Knowing if it’s Scotch 200, or Scotch 250, or Scotch 300 is relevant for the preservation purposes.  When the info is available, it’s usually written clearly on the box. Older tapes will often have named lines of tape, sometimes on a shiny sticker or something that might say, for example, “Radio Mastering Extraordinaire”. This can be helpful to know, and would be great to record, if it’s readily available. If it’s not obvious, then write down “Unknown acetate”.</p>
